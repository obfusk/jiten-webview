Jiten [Online] is a Japanese dictionary based on JMDict/Kanjidic

This app essentially provides the same functionality as opening the https://jiten.obfusk.dev website in a web browser — but with some small advantages (like long press for tooltips).

There is also a completely offline version — named simply "Jiten Japanese Dictionary" — which requires more storage space (and could be slower depending on your device and internet connection).  You can install both at the same time if you want.

Features:

JMDict multilingual japanese dictionary
• kanji, readings (romaji optional), meanings & more
• meanings in english, dutch, german, french and/or spanish
• pitch accent (from Wadoku)
• browse by frequency/jlpt

Kanji dictionary
• readings (romaji optional), meanings (english), jmdict entries, radicals & more
• search using SKIP codes
• search by radical
• browse by frequency/level/jlpt

Example sentences (from Tatoeba)
• with english, dutch, german, french and/or spanish translation
• some with audio

Stroke order
• input a word or sentence and see how it's written

Fine-grained search using regexes (regular expressions)
• simple searches don't require knowledge of regexes
• quick reference available

• Dark mode
• Search history (stored locally)
• Use long press for tooltips: quickly see meanings and readings for kanji and words
• Easily share and open jiten.obfusk.dev links
